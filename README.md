ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Selahadin Jemal. A Software Engineer. I Specialize in Full-Stack Web development. I Mainly use React in the frontend and I use popular UILibraries like Material UI and CSS Libraries like Tailwind. And for the backend I use Laravel, Spring-boot, Dot net, and Node with the usual DBMSs and their ORMs. I call my self a "realistic perfectionist" which by my definitions is, a person who worries / nerds about the minute details of a task to a reasonable degree. well a little above that.. As a software engineer, I like to challenge my self and wear different hats. I'm interested in all aspect of a software journey i.e. programming, testing, ci/cd, servers etc..

Feel free to reach out!
