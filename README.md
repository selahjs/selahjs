ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Selahadin Jemal.
Well, a Software Engineer, I Specialize in Fullstack Web development. I Mainly use React in the frontend and I use popular ui Libraries like Material UI and css Libraries like Tailwind. And for the backend I use Laravel, Springboot, Dot net, and Node with the usuall dbms and their orm. 
I call my self a "realistic perfectionist" which by my definitions is, a person who worries / nerds about the minute details of to a reasonable degree. well a little above that.. As a software engineer, I like to challenge my self and wear different hats. I'm interested in all aspect of a software journy i.e. programming, testing, ci/cd, serveres...
